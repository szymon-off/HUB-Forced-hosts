# ⚠️ Fork of @uebliche's [HUB](https://github.com/uebliche/HUB) plugin
This fork introduces the capability to utilize Velocity forced hosts. Players who connect with a properly set up forced host will bypass the lobby.

# Hub Plugin for Velocity Proxy

<!-- modrinth_exclude.end -->

This project is a **Hub Plugin** for the **Velocity Proxy Server**. It automatically connects players to the best
available lobby servers based on permissions, server load, and other criteria. The plugin includes advanced debugging
features and offers full customization through a configuration file.

## Features

- **Automatic Server Selection**: Automatically connects players to the best available lobby server.
- **Multiple Lobbies**: Supports multiple lobby types with individual permissions and priorities.
- **Customizable Messages**: Success messages and system notifications can be fully customized using **MiniMessage**
  syntax.
- **Dynamic Commands**: Fully customizable commands and permissions for different lobbies.
- **Debugging Mode**: Enable debug mode to troubleshoot issues with detailed messages.
- **Placeholder Support**: Supports placeholders for server and player information.

## Installation

1. **Requirements**:

    - Velocity Proxy Server (latest version)
    - **Java 21**

2. **Plugin Download**:

    - [Download here from Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/hub)

3. **Installation**:

    - Place the JAR file in the `plugins` directory of your Velocity server.

4. **Restart the Server**:

    - Restart your Velocity server to load the plugin.

## Configuration

After the server's first start, a `config.yml` file will be generated in the plugin directory. This file allows full
customization, including commands, permissions, messages, and server behaviors. You can adjust everything to meet your
server's needs.

### MiniMessage and Regex Support

The plugin supports **MiniMessage** syntax for customizing messages. You can easily style your messages using
MiniMessage tags like `<i>`, `<b>`, and `<color>`. For a quick preview or to test your MiniMessage strings, visit
the [MiniMessage web editor](https://webui.advntr.dev/).

For custom server filters and other patterns, **Regex** is supported. Test your expressions easily with
a [Regex editor](https://regex101.com/).
